# FEATURES DONE

## Scraper Worker

- Refactored the monolithic Express scraper into Router - Controller - Service layers.
- Preserved the existing API contract for `/api/scrape`, `/api/status/:jobId`, and `/api/health`.
- Fixed TypeScript NodeNext import resolution by using `.js` extensions in source imports.
- Kept Crawlee job isolation with per-job datasets and cleanup behavior.
